# Ensures a locally-trusted HTTPS certificate exists for the Vite dev server, so
# browsers treat https://localhost:3000 as fully secure - no click-through
# warning, and no permission (geolocation, etc.) getting reset because the
# self-signed cert changed on the last restart. Safe to re-run: skips work
# that's already done. See vite.config.ts for how the result gets used.
#
# Also covers the machine's current LAN IP, not just localhost - `pnpm dev`
# already binds to 0.0.0.0 (`vite --host`), and testing from a phone on the
# same Wi-Fi is the main reason HTTPS matters at all here (localhost itself is
# already a secure context without a cert - see docs/DEV-HTTPS.md). Since a
# laptop's LAN IP can change between sessions (DHCP), this re-checks the
# existing cert's SANs against the current IP and regenerates only if it's
# missing, rather than trusting "the files exist" alone.
