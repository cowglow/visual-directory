// TASK.md section 8: "Add tests that <script>/<img onerror> payloads render
// as inert text." This app's vitest setup only runs *.test.ts, not *.tsx (see
// CLAUDE.md), so there's no component-rendering/jsdom harness to mount
// LocationsMapView/LocationsListView and assert on the DOM - a real render
// test belongs in e2e/*.spec.ts instead (Playwright, against a live
// frontend+backend). This is the *.test.ts-compatible complement: a static
// guarantee, across every file in this feature, that label/note (or any
// other participant-controlled string) is never routed through `innerHTML`,
// `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, or MapLibre's `Popup#setHTML` - the exact three
// APIs that would turn a "<script>"/"<img onerror>" payload into executing
// markup instead of inert text. If nobody ever calls those APIs, no payload
// can ever become markup, in this file or the next one added later.
// Matches actual usage (a JSX prop or object-literal assignment / a method
// call), not just the word appearing in a comment explaining why it's
// forbidden - this file's own doc comments (and this file's own pattern
// list) say these names out loud, so a bare substring match would flag
// itself.
